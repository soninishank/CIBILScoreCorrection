Loan settlement affects your CIBIL score and stays in your report for years.  
But it is possible to rebuild your score and regain eligibility.

---

## Step 1: Pay any remaining settlement balance  
If the bank asks for a small difference amount, pay it to update the report faster.

---

## Step 2: Request the lender to update status correctly  
Make sure the report shows:

- **Settled – updated**, or  
- **Closed**, if fully repaid

---

## Step 3: Start adding positive credit  
Use these:

- Secured credit card  
- Low limit card  
- Small EMI loan  
- Auto-debit payments

---

## Step 4: Reduce card usage  
Keep credit utilization under **20–30%**.

---

## Step 5: Avoid any new loan applications  
Give your score at least 3 months to improve.

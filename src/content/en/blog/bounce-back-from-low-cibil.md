Seeing a low CIBIL score (below 650) can be disheartening. You might feel like you've been blacklisted from the financial world. But here is the truth: **A low score is not a life sentence.** It is a temporary status that reflects your *past* behavior, not your *future* potential.

Yes, you can bounce back. And thousands of people do it every year.

## The "Bounce Back" Timeline

How long does it take? That depends on why your score dropped in the first place.
*   **Minor slips (One late payment):** Recovery in **3-6 months**.
*   **High Utilization (Maxed out cards):** Recovery in **1-3 months** after paying down balances.
*   **Major defaults (Settlements/Write-offs):** Recovery takes **12-24 months** of consistent positive behavior.

## How to Start Your Recovery Journey

### 1. Stop the Bleeding
If you are still missing payments, stop immediately. Prioritize your EMIs. Every new late payment pushes your recovery date further away. Automate your payments so you never miss a due date again.

### 2. Don't Desperate-Apply
When banks say "No," don't run to another bank. Multiple rejections in a short time will crash your score further. **Stop applying for new credit completely** for at least 6 months.

### 3. The "Secured Card" Strategy
If no one will give you a loan, how do you prove you can pay one back? Enter the **Secured Credit Card**.
*   **How it works:** You give the bank a fixed deposit (e.g., ₹20,000), and they give you a credit card with 80-90% of that limit.
*   **Why it works:** Banks approve these easily because they have your deposit as collateral.
*   **The Trick:** Use this card for small expenses (like fuel or groceries) and pay the **full bill** on time every month. This builds a fresh, positive payment history that will gradually overpower your past mistakes.

### 4. Patiently Wait for "Settled" Accounts to Age
If you have a "Settled" status on your report, it negatively impacts your score. While you can't remove a genuine settlement, its impact fades over time. As recent years fill up with green "On-Time" ticks, the old red flags matter less to the CIBIL algorithm.

## Conclusion
Rebuilding a CIBIL score is like losing weight—there are no magic pills, only diet (spending control) and exercise (timely payments). Start today, be consistent, and watch your score climb back into the green zone.

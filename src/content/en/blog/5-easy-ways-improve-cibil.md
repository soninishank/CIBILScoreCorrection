Improving your CIBIL score doesn't always require a masters degree in finance. Sometimes, small, smart tweaks to how you manage your credit can yield quick results. If you are looking to polish your score before a loan application, here are 5 easy ways to do it.

## 1. The "30% Rule" for Credit Cards
This is the easiest and fastest hack. Your Credit Utilization Ratio (CUR) is the % of your limit you use.
*   **Bad:** Limit ₹1 Lakh, Spent ₹90,000 (90% utilization).
*   **Good:** Limit ₹1 Lakh, Spent ₹25,000 (25% utilization).

**Action:** Before your bill is generated, pay down your credit card balance to bring it under 30% of your limit. Your score can see a jump as soon as the next month's report is generated!

## 2. Request a Limit Increase
If you can't reduce your spending, increase your limit!
*   **Scenario:** You spend ₹50,000 monthly.
    *   Limit ₹1 Lakh = 50% Utilization (High).
    *   Limit ₹2 Lakh = 25% Utilization (Ideal).

**Action:** Call your bank and ask for a credit limit increase. If you have a good track record, they will often do it for free. This instantly lowers your utilization ratio without you spending a rupee less.

## 3. Don't Close Old Credit Cards
You might think closing an old, unused card is "cleaning up." **Don't do it!**
*   **Why?** An old card gives you a long "Credit History," which boosts your score.
*   **Why else?** Closing a card reduces your *Total Available Credit*, which might spike your utilization ratio on other cards.

**Action:** Keep the old card active. Use it once a year for a small purchase to keep it alive.

## 4. Become an Authorized User (Piggybacking)
This is a lesser-known trick. If your spouse or parent has a credit card with a long, perfect payment history and a high limit, ask to be added as an **Authorized User** (Add-on cardholder).
*   **Result:** In many cases, the primary card's positive history gets reflected on your credit report too, giving you an instant boost.

## 5. Pay Twice a Month
Don't wait for the due date. Pay your credit card bill in two halves—once in the middle of the month and once at the end.
*   **Benefit:** This ensures your reported "daily balance" remains low throughout the month, protecting you from accidental high utilization spikes.

## Final Thoughts
These tips are quick wins, but consistency is key. Combine these strategies with 100% on-time payments, and you will see your CIBIL score moving in the right direction in no time.

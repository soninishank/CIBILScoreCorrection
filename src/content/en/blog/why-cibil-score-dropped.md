A sudden drop in your CIBIL score can be stressful — especially when you know you haven’t done anything wrong.  
But the truth is, many score drops happen due to **hidden or technical factors** that most people never notice.

Here are the **7 most common reasons** and what you can do to fix them quickly.

---

## 1. A missed EMI or credit card payment  
Even a single missed EMI creates **DPD (Days Past Due)** and drops your score by 40–80 points.

**Fix:**  
Pay the overdue amount immediately. Once your DPD becomes “000” for 1–2 cycles, the score starts recovering.

---

## 2. High credit card utilization  
If your credit card limit is ₹1,00,000 and you spend ₹80,000, utilization becomes **80%**, which drastically reduces your score.

**Fix:**  
Keep utilization below **30%**.

---

## 3. Incorrect reporting by bank/NBFC  
Banks sometimes report wrong data such as:

- Paid loan marked as overdue  
- Closed loan showing as active  
- Wrong DPD entries  
- Duplicate loans  

**Fix:**  
Raise a dispute with CIBIL or the lender.

---

## 4. Multiple loan applications  
Every loan or credit card application creates a “hard inquiry,” which reduces your score.

**Fix:**  
Avoid new applications for 3–4 months.

---

## 5. Account closed by credit card company  
If your card issuer closes your card due to inactivity, your score can drop.

**Fix:**  
Try to reactivate or add a new credit line.

---

## 6. Old settled loan showing as “written-off”  
This is extremely common and kills your score.

**Fix:**  
Request a “closure/settlement update” from the lender and update CIBIL.

---

## 7. Fraudulent account  
Sometimes lenders mistakenly report accounts belonging to someone else.

**Fix:**  
Immediately raise a dispute with the bureau.

---

## Final takeaway  
A sudden drop always has a reason.

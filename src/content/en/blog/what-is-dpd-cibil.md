DPD, or **Days Past Due**, is arguably the single most important number in your CIBIL report. It is a direct reflection of your payment discipline and is the first thing lenders check when evaluating your loan or credit card application. A clean DPD is the foundation of a high CIBIL score.

## What Exactly is DPD?

DPD is a monthly record of your payment history for each of your loans and credit cards. It shows whether you paid your dues on time for that specific month or how many days the payment was delayed.

When you look at the "Payment History" section of your CIBIL report, you will see a grid with months and corresponding DPD values.

### How to Read DPD Codes:
*   **000:** This is the ideal status. It means the payment for that month was made **on time** (within the due date).
*   **XXX:** This means there is no data reported by the lender for that month. This is common for new accounts or when there are reporting gaps.
*   **030, 060, 090:** These numbers indicate that the payment was overdue by **30, 60, or 90 days**, respectively.
*   **STD, SUB, DBT, LSS:** These are asset classification codes.
    *   **STD (Standard):** A standard, healthy account.
    *   **SUB (Sub-Standard):** The account is overdue for more than 90 days.
    *   **DBT (Doubtful):** A high-risk account.
    *   **LSS (Loss):** The bank has written off the account as a loss.

## Why is a High DPD Dangerous for Your Score?

Your payment history accounts for about 35% of your CIBIL score calculation. DPD is the primary metric used to judge this.
*   **Severe Score Drop:** Even a single instance of a "030" DPD can drop your score by **50-80 points**. A "090" DPD is even more catastrophic.
*   **Loan Rejection:** Lenders see any DPD other than "000" as a major red flag. It tells them you are an unreliable borrower, leading to almost certain loan rejection.
*   **Higher Interest Rates:** If a lender does approve your loan despite a poor DPD, they will likely charge a much higher interest rate to compensate for the perceived risk.

## How to Fix DPD on Your CIBIL Report

Fixing a DPD entry can be challenging, but it's not impossible. Here are the steps you can take:

### 1. Pay All Overdue Amounts Immediately
If you have any pending EMIs or bills, pay them off completely. While this won't remove the historical DPD entry, it will stop it from getting worse and your score will begin to recover over time as you build a new record of on-time payments.

### 2. Make a "Goodwill Request" to the Lender
If the late payment was a one-time mistake due to a genuine reason (like a medical emergency, job loss, or a technical bank error), you can write to the lender and request a "goodwill correction."
*   **How to do it:** Explain your situation politely and provide any supporting documents. If you have been a loyal customer with a good past record, the bank might agree to remove the negative DPD entry.

### 3. Raise a Dispute for Incorrect DPD
Studies show that a significant percentage of CIBIL reports contain errors. If you are certain that the DPD on your report is incorrect and you have proof of on-time payment:
*   **Gather Proof:** Collect bank statements, payment receipts, or any communication that proves you paid on time.
*   **File a Dispute:** Go to the CIBIL website and file an online dispute. Upload your proof and clearly state why the DPD is incorrect. CIBIL will then work with the lender to verify and correct the error.

## Conclusion
Maintaining a "000" DPD across all your accounts is the key to a high CIBIL score. Always monitor your report, pay your bills on time, and act quickly to correct any errors you find.

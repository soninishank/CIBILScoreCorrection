DPD (Days Past Due) is the single most important number in your CIBIL report — and also the biggest reason loan applications get rejected.

---

## What exactly is DPD?

DPD tells lenders whether you paid your EMI **on time** for every month.

- **000 = Paid on time**  
- **XXX = No data**  
- **030 / 060 / 090 = Payment overdue for 1–3 months**  
- **WR, WO, SUB** = Written-off or settled (very harmful)

---

## Why DPD is dangerous  
Lenders check DPD before approving loans. Even **one late payment** can cause:

- Lower score  
- Loan rejection  
- Higher interest rate  

---

## How to fix DPD fast  

### 1. Pay the overdue amount  
This is the fastest way to recover.

### 2. Request the bank for goodwill correction  
If you missed a payment due to:

- Medical emergency  
- Job loss  
- Bank error  

Banks sometimes remove DPD as a goodwill gesture.

### 3. Raise a dispute if the DPD is wrong  
30–40% DPD entries in India are **incorrect**.

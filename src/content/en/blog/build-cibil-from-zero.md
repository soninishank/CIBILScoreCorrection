If you are new to credit and have no CIBIL score, banks consider you “unscored,” which makes loan approval difficult.

Here’s how to build your score from scratch.

---

## Step 1: Get a secured credit card  
Open a fixed deposit (FD) and get a credit card against it.

---

## Step 2: Use the card for small monthly expenses  
Pay the bill in full every time.

---

## Step 3: Keep utilization low  
Spend only **10–20%** of your limit.

---

## Step 4: Add an EMI loan after 3–6 months  
A small loan helps create credit history faster.

---

## Step 5: Never miss a payment  
Even one late payment can ruin your score.

---

Within 6–9 months, you can reach a **700+ score** easily.

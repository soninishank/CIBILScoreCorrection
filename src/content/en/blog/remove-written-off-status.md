A “written-off” status is one of the most harmful entries in your CIBIL report.  
It indicates that the lender has marked your loan as **unrecoverable**, which scares all future lenders.

Here’s how to fix it.

---

## Step 1: Understand the type of write-off  
There are two types:

### 1. **Settled**  
You paid only part of the loan.

### 2. **Written-off**  
Bank marked your account as unrecoverable.

Both reduce your score by 100–150 points.

---

## Step 2: Request a settlement or full payment  
If the amount is manageable:

- Pay the remaining balance  
- Collect **NOC** (closure letter)

---

## Step 3: Ask the lender to update the status  
After payment, request the bank to update status to:

- **Closed** (best)  
- **Settled — updated** (acceptable)

---

## Step 4: Raise a bureau dispute  
Update reflects in 30 days.

---

## Final Note  
Removing written-off status is tricky but possible with correct documentation.

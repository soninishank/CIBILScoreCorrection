Improving your CIBIL score is not magic — it is a **structured process** that anyone can follow.  
If you follow the right steps consistently, you can significantly increase your score in **30–90 days**.

Below is a clear, practical guide used by professionals.

---

## 1. Download your latest credit report  
Before fixing anything, you must see the full picture.

Download updated reports from all three bureaus:

- **CIBIL**
- **Experian**
- **Equifax**

You can download a free report once every 12 months or access paid versions anytime.

> **Tip:** Always work with your latest report. Old reports cause confusion and delay.

---

## 2. Identify incorrect entries (the biggest score killers)

Most low CIBIL scores are caused by errors like:

- Wrong **DPD** (Days Past Due)
- Past loan showing as **written-off** even after settlement
- A closed loan still appearing as **active**
- Incorrect credit card limits or utilization
- Loans you never took (fraud / misreporting)
- Duplicate entries

Highlight all incorrect or suspicious points — these are the fastest items to fix.

---

## 3. Raise disputes with documentation

Once you find mistakes, you need to raise disputes with either:

- The lending institution (bank/NBFC)  
- The credit bureau (CIBIL/Equifax/Experian)

Attach supporting documents such as:

- Payment receipts  
- Loan closure letter / NOC  
- Settlement letter  
- ID proof  
- Bank statements showing payment  

Corrections usually take **10–30 days** depending on the lender.

---

## 4. Reduce your active DPD immediately

DPD entries damage your score more than anything else.  
To fix DPD quickly:

- Pay **minimum due** on credit cards  
- Clear any **pending EMI**  
- If payment is large, request a **temporary settlement** or **one-time payment plan**

Once DPD becomes "000" for 2–3 months, your score improves rapidly.

---

## 5. Lower your credit utilization (very important)

Credit utilization should be **below 30%** of your credit card limit.

Example:  
If your credit limit is ₹1,00,000 → keep monthly usage under ₹30,000.

High utilization can drop your score even if you pay on time.

---

## 6. Avoid new loan applications for a few months

Each new loan application creates a **hard inquiry**, which lowers your score.  
During the improvement phase:

- Do **not** apply for new loans  
- Do **not** apply for multiple credit cards  
- Avoid "check CIBIL score" apps that generate inquiries

Let your score stabilize first.

---

## 7. Add positive credit accounts (optional booster)

If your report has very few accounts, adding a new low-risk product helps:

- Low-limit credit card  
- Secured credit card against FD  
- Small consumer loan with EMI auto-debit

Timely payments on these increase your score in 60–90 days.

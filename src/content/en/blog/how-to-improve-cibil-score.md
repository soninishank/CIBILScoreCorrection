Improving your CIBIL score is not magic—it is a **structured process** that anyone can follow. A low score can be frustrating, but if you take the right steps consistently, you can see a significant improvement in just **30–90 days**.

This guide provides a clear, practical, 7-step process used by professionals to repair and build credit scores.

## Step 1: Download and Analyze Your Latest Credit Report
Before you can fix the problem, you need to understand it completely. The first step is always to get a copy of your most recent credit report.

*   **Where to get it:** Download updated reports from all three major credit bureaus in India: **CIBIL, Experian, and Equifax**.
*   **Why all three?** Lenders may report to any or all of these bureaus, so an error might exist on one report but not another.
*   **Tip:** Always work with your latest report. Using an old report can cause confusion and delay the repair process.

## Step 2: Identify Incorrect Entries (The Biggest Score Killers)
A surprisingly high number of low CIBIL scores are caused by reporting errors. Carefully review your report and look for these common mistakes:
*   **Incorrect DPD (Days Past Due):** This is when you've paid on time, but the lender has reported it as a late payment.
*   **"Written-Off" or "Settled" Status:** A past loan that was settled may still be incorrectly marked as "Written-Off."
*   **A Closed Loan Still Showing as "Active":** This can affect your debt-to-income ratio.
*   **Fraudulent Accounts:** Loans or credit cards that you never applied for.
*   **Duplicate Entries:** The same loan or credit card appearing twice.

Highlight every incorrect or suspicious entry. Fixing these errors is often the fastest way to boost your score.

## Step 3: Raise Disputes with Lenders and Bureaus
Once you've identified the mistakes, you need to get them corrected.
*   **Start with the Lender:** Contact the bank or NBFC first. Provide them with proof (e.g., payment receipts, NOC) and request a correction.
*   **Escalate to the Bureau:** If the lender is unresponsive, raise a dispute directly with the credit bureau (CIBIL, Experian, etc.) through their online dispute resolution portal.
*   **Documentation is Key:** Attach clear copies of supporting documents like payment receipts, a No Objection Certificate (NOC), settlement letters, and bank statements.

Corrections typically take **10–30 days**, depending on how quickly the lender responds to the bureau's request.

## Step 4: Clear All Overdue Payments Immediately
DPD entries are the single most damaging factor to your score. If you have any outstanding payments, clear them as soon as possible. Once your DPD for all active accounts becomes **"000"** (meaning no late payments) and stays that way for 2-3 months, your score will begin to improve rapidly.

## Step 5: Lower Your Credit Utilization Ratio (Crucial)
Your Credit Utilization Ratio (CUR) is the percentage of your available credit that you are using. It is recommended to keep your CUR **below 30%**.

*   **Example:** If your total credit card limit is ₹1,00,000, you should aim to keep your monthly outstanding balance under ₹30,000.
*   **Why it matters:** High utilization signals to lenders that you are heavily reliant on credit, which is seen as risky behavior. Lowering it can provide a quick boost to your score.

## Step 6: Avoid New Loan Applications for a Few Months
Every time you apply for a new loan or credit card, it results in a **"Hard Enquiry"** on your report, which can temporarily lower your score by a few points.
*   **The Rule:** During the credit improvement phase, avoid applying for any new credit. Let your score recover and stabilize first.

## Step 7: Build Positive Credit with a New Account (Optional)
If your credit report has very few accounts or only negative ones, it can be beneficial to add a new line of positive credit.
*   **What to get:** A **Secured Credit Card** (against an FD) is the best option, as approval is guaranteed.
*   **How to use it:** Use it for small, regular transactions and pay the bill in full every month. This adds positive payment data to your report and helps build a strong credit history over 6-9 months.

## Conclusion: Patience and Professional Guidance
Improving a CIBIL score is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires discipline, consistency, and patience. By following these steps, you can take control of your financial health and achieve a score that opens doors to better opportunities.
